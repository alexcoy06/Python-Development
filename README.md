# Basic Python Practice

Completing Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Python" course is a transformative journey that equips learners with fundamental and practical Python programming skills. Over the course of 100 days, participants engage in daily coding challenges and build numerous projects, ranging from games and automation scripts to data analysis tools and web applications. Through these hands-on experiences, learners gain proficiency in essential Python concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and object-oriented programming. The course also introduces key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, enhancing skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Ultimately, graduates emerge with a solid foundation in Python and the confidence to tackle diverse coding challenges and real-world applications.

## Repository Structure

The `main.py` files are the actual projects I completed. Any file named `sub-main.py` was either a coding exercise from [auditorium.ai](https://auditorium.ai/) or part of a lesson I was following that day on [replit.com](https://replit.com/). These instances of code were noteworthy.

- **Day-1:** Creating a simple name generator for bands, using basic python.
- **Day-2:** Using string manipulation to create a tip calculator.
- **Day-3:** Using my understanding of logical operators to create text-based adventure game.
- **Day-4:** Using my understanding for list to create a rock-paper-scissors game.
- **Day-5:** Using my understanding of for loops to create a password generator.
- **Day-6:** Completing a [maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) with my understanding of while loops.
- **Day-7:** Used all skills learned to create a hangman game.
- **Day-8:** Used all skills learned to create a Caesar Cipher.
- **Day-9:** Used all skills learned to create a Secret Auction.
